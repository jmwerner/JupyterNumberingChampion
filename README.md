# JupyterNumberingChampion
Have you ever wished you could shift the output cell numbering in your jupyter notebooks? Wish no more, this script will shift every number by a specified value that defaults to -1. 

This script takes a jupyter notebook as its first and only command line argument and overwrites the notebook with shifted numbers.

#### Example Call
```bash 
python jupyterNumberingChampion.py notebook.ipynb
```

#### Future
If a future need or demand is seen and time allows, this will eventually be turned into a full-blown jupyter notebook extension.
